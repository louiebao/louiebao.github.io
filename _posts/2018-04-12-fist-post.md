### First Post On GitHub Pages
I used to maintain a WordPress blog site louiebao.net hosted on Azure but I have since lost the MySql database due to discontinued service. Have heard about GitHub Pages for a while but never had the incentive to move until now.

Don't really want to bother with jekyll and all so the intention is to keep this site as bare bone as possible. I will slowly migrate posts from the old site (luckily I had a backup) that are worth keeping and as the Chinglish saying goes: 
> If the old doesn't go, the new doesn't come."
